## Create, rename and delete a backup
On the left sidebar, you can see a button that says "Add Backup". Once you click it, a popup opens and you can input the name. To ultimately create the new backup, either press the "Enter" key or click the create-button. To undo, simply click the "Cancel"-button or press the "Escape" key.
Renaming and deleteting can be done by pressing their respective button next to the backup name on the sidebar. In one case you will be asked to input the new name and in the other case you need to confirm the deletion  

## Configure a backup
After creating a backup, it appears as a new item in the list. You can select it by clicking on it. To configure the backup even further, click on the cogwheel-icon at the top so a new popup opens. It provides you the chance to change to folder the generated backup in placed into. Additionally you can adjust whether the created backup should be zipped or not. This can be useful if you intend to share the backup with others.

## Add and modify entries
Until you add any entries to a backup, it's practically useless. So, to add one, press the "Add entry" button close to the horizontal center of your screen. Next, you will be greeted by the "Add backup entry" popup. It allows you to switch between the two types a backup entry can copy: a "file" or a "folder".
Backuping a file is very straightforward. You simply select the path of the origin and input the path of the target location. If you're not sure what happens next, hover over the i icon that will display useful documentation.
When backuping a folder, you have access to three filters: Maximum file size, included file names and included file size. Each of these filters grants you control about which files should be really backuped and which you should be skipped. 
In case you frequently want to enable or disable backup entries this can be achieved by clicking the similar looking buttons.

## Execute a backup
Before executing the backup, check for yellow borders around backup entires. These indicate an empty path that could cause an error or lead to unexpected behaviour.
When it finally comes to executing a backup just click the corresponding blue button at the top of the page. Then everything will handle itself - nothing to worry about.
After the execution there will appear logs below the button. They highlight all important information like successful copies, failed ones and skipped files. This feature lets you easily check whether all your wanted files/folders were actually correctly backuped.

## View the results
By default the backup is created on your Desktop. If you modified the location of the backup before, you probably need to look at the backup configuration again or simply open your file explorer at the particular location.
